# FIFA Player Height Analysis

## Overview

In recent editions of the FIFA video game series, many players have noticed a shift in gameplay — particularly, that crossing the ball and scoring headers have become less effective. One common theory is that this change is due to a decline in the average height of players in the game over time.

This project investigates that claim by analyzing player data from FIFA 11 and FIFA 21, focusing on whether player heights have changed significantly and how this might relate to aerial abilities such as jumping and heading.

## Key Questions

- Has the average height of players changed from 2011 to 2021?
- How has the distribution of player heights evolved?
- Is there a relationship between height, jumping, and heading abilities?
- Have other physical traits like weight or strength changed over time?

## Requirements

This project only uses basic Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
