#  FIFA Height Analysis: A Decade of Change in Player Profiles
 
## Project Overview

In recent years, FIFA players have noted a significant change in gameplay strategies — particularly, the ineffectiveness of traditional crossing and heading techniques. A widely circulated hypothesis suggests that **the average height of football players in FIFA has decreased over the years**, making aerial duels and headers less successful. This project aims to **analyze player data from FIFA 11 and FIFA 21** to verify whether this claim holds true.

Using official player datasets from both versions of the game, this analysis explores how player height has evolved over the decade and how this may relate to gameplay changes, especially in terms of scoring from crosses.

## 🔍 Key Questions

- Has the average height of players changed from 2011 to 2021?
- How has the distribution of player heights evolved?
- Does height correlate with heading and jumping ability?
- Have weight and strength changed over time?



## 📦 Requirements

This project uses only essential Python data libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

No external APIs or advanced frameworks are required.
